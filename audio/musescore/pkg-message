The only supported sound output is currently JACK. You should make
sure jackd is running (jackd -r -d oss), then enable it in MuseScore
preferences:

Edit -> Preferences -> I/O -> [X] Use internal synthesizer ->
                                             -> [X] JACK Audio Server

Restart MuseScore, and the sound should work. You may still need to
select different JACK ports for left/right channel in preferences.
