The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality
that would otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for
various projects and platforms, such as loading a sound file into
an OpenAL buffer and streaming an audio file through a buffer queue.
Support for different formats is consistant across platforms, so
no special checks are needed when loading files, and all formats
are handled through the same API.

Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader, and can
leverage external libraries such as libSndFile (for extended wave
formats and several others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis), FLAC (for
FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and others. External libraries can also be
dynamically loaded at run-time, or individually disabled outright
at compile time.
