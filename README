Private FreeBSD ports overlay with ports which are work-in-progress
or are in sme way not really suitable for the official tree.

Please consult individual ports' AMDmi3-README.txt files for more info.
Fields which may be encountered in these files:

Source:
  Source of a port if it was not written from scratch by me. It may
  be other person, or the port may be based on existing one from the
  ports collection.

Completeness:
  A port may be on various stages of completion (it may fetch only
  but not build, build or not install, install but no deinstall
  cleanly etc.). "Full" means the port is complete and has everything
  to be committed into the ports collection.

Usability:
  Even if port builds and install successfully, it may be not fully
  useable - there may be bugs, missing features or it may segfault.
  "Full" means that there was some testing and there were no known
  problems.

Not in tree:
  Reason the port is not committed to the FreeBSD ports tree. It may
  be incomplete (see Complete field), it may not work as it should
  (see Usability field), there may be license issues or I just don't
  see it useable enough for the tree (e.g. library with no consumers).
  In the latter case, if you need it please contact me and I'll commit
  it right away.

Tinderbox:
  Date and result of last tinderbox ([1]) testing, which is used to
  confirm that the port builds and installs successfully and deinstalls
  cleanly. I usually use jails with latest releases in all stable
  branches (for the time of this writing, these are 7.4-RELEASE and
  8.2-RELEASE), both i386 and amd64, with additional jail with
  non-default PREFIX/LOCALBASE/X11BASE setting. One of the jails also
  tests various OPTIONS combinations (for each option, it builds the
  port with this options switched to non-default state) and with
  NOPORTDOCS.
