Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) tries
to maximize randomized traffic to memory from processor and I/O,
with the intent of creating a realistic high load situation in order
to test the existing hardware devices in a computer. It has been
used at Google for some time and now it is available under the
apache 2.0 license.
