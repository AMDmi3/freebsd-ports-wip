Justniffer is a tcp packet sniffer. It can log network traffic in
a customizable way. Can simulate web server logs as the Apache
access_log. May include information such as response times. Useful
to troubleshoot performance issues. It can also capture http traffic
content (html, javascript, css, images, sounds, etc..) and save it
in a directory
