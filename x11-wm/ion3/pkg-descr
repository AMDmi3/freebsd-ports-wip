Ion is a simple but extensible Window Manager that is closer to
Ratpoison and PWM than to anything else.

With Ion, the screen is divided into frames, and each program simply
lives in the frame it's provided. All Ion commands are keyboard-based.
Ion is also highly configurable and extensible through Lua.

Think of Ion like an X11 version of Screen.
