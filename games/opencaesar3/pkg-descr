openCaesar3 is a remake of the classic Caesar3 PC game, a city
building game developed by Impression Games and published by Sierra
Entertainment, in 1998.

The game will be a near clone of the original Caesar3 game. Notable
changes are:

o A new AI for walkers. They will walk where they are needed the
  most.
o Actors coming from the actor school do not provide access to the
  entertainment. The same goes for lion tamers, gladiators and horse
  wagons.

The game is currently under heavy development and not in a playable
state. Developers are invited to participate
