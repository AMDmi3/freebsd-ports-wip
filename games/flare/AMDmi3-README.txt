Completeness:	does not install, descr missing, COMMENT missing
Usability:	playable from work/
Not in ports:	work in progress
Comments:       systemwide installation is not supported upstream
		yet, but the game is quite playable from work/:

		make && cd work/flare_src_v013 && ./flare

		Note that savegames are stored in workdir as well,
		so you may want to save them someplace in order not
		to lose them
