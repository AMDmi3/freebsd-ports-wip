Search and Rescue is a flight simulator in which the player flies
around a 3-D world, finding and rescuing people in distress. The
game takes a step away from combat simulators and, instead, encourages
players to save people who need rescuing.

The player is given a series of missions in which they are tasked
with searching for and picking up people in need of help. There is
also a Free Flight mode in which the player can select an aircraft
and fly around without any objectives.
