Box2D is a 2D rigid body simulation library for games. Programmer's
can use it in their games to make objects move in believable ways
and make the world seem more interactive. From the game's point of
view a physics engine is just a system for procedural animation.
Rather than paying (or begging) an animator to move your actors
around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do the directing.

Box2D is written in portable C++. Most of the types defined in the
engine begin with the b2 prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to
avoid name clashing with your game engine.
