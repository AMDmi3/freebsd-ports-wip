MyPaint is a fast painting/scribbling program. It supports pressure
sensitive graphic tablets and comes with an easy to use brush
collection. There is a complex interface for creating your own brushes,
focusing on brush dynamics (changes with speed, pressure, or randomly).
The canvas size is unlimited and undo is supported, but not layers.
