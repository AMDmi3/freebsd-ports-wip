Monster Script (or just Monster) is an advanced scripting language
made for game programming.

Monster is an object oriented programming language with syntax
similar to D, C++ and Java. It is a byte-code compiled language
(like Java) and scripts must be run through a virtual machine (VM).
Rather than being a stand-alone program, however, the Monster VM
is a library. It is meant to be integrated into an existing client
program (written in D or C++, for example), where the VM runs
side-by-side with "native" code.

Monster is meant to be a control language - it should give you a
simple but flexible language to express high-level behavior, and
let you put the low-level "back end" code in native code. Exactly
where you draw the line between scripted code and native code is
up to you.

The Monster compiler and VM are written entirely in the D programming
language, but bindings to C++ are included. You do not need a D
compiler og any knowledge of D to use Monster in C++.
